ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Bonjour, Iâ€™m Moira O'Neill (@moira-du-monde)

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in economic and urban geography at Kent State University in Ohio, USA.
  
My research merges **complexity science with spatial analysis and modeling, and I use these tools to develop and test new theories in political economy.**
Ongoing research projects include 
       1) using gaming models to detect institutional sources of spatial inequality,
       2) state controls on foreign direct investment (FDI) in essential and/or geostrategic industries (with S. Bagchi-Sen), 
       3) analyzing the relationship between global defense alliances and financial networks,
       4) the economics of political independence (with M. Gawrys), and
       5) the relationship between geopolitical and/or domestic instability and the spatial distribution of defense spending.
  
I've also published on [human capital development (with S. Bagchi-Sen)]([url](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-022-10636-1)) and mapping complex disease networks (with J. Lee in *Spatiotemporal Analytics* forthcoming at CRC Press, a division of Taylor and Francis).

ðŸ“« I'm always excited to connect with folks with similar or complementary research interests.  Please drop me a line at moneil18@kent.edu if you would like to collaborate or chat.
