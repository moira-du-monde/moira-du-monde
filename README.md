ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Bonjour, Iâ€™m Moira O'Neill (@moira-du-monde)

Iâ€™m a geospatial data scientist splitting time between Ohio and NY.
  
I'm especially excited about complex systems modeling.

I've also published on [detecting coordination failure in regional political and economic environments]([url](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21622671.2023.2175030)), [human capital development (with S. Bagchi-Sen)]([url](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-022-10636-1)) and mapping complex disease networks (forthcoming with J. Lee).

ðŸ“« I'm always excited to connect with folks with similar or complementary research interests.  Please drop me a line at moira@arriveanalytics.com if you would like to collaborate or chat.
